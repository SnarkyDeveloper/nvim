# SnarkyDev's NeoVim Config

This a super speedy and feature packed configuration for neovim, it has a lot of useful keybindings you may have when switching over from vscode, while also being efficent. There is a large amount of support for languages with more coming soon.

## Startup Time

I have been working on optimizing my startup time and it is currently sitting at around ~22ms on charge and ~55ms on battery.

## Dependencies

Please ensure you have cargo and the rust toolchain installed on your system as it is essential for many plugins to work.

## Setup

I have made a very simple plug and play setup script, which you can run by doing the following. You can also clone  the git repository and manually transfer over your settings and old configuration files. Make sure to install [the dependencies.](#dependencies)

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SnarkyDeveloper/nvim/refs/heads/main/setup.sh | bash
```
